1. Who Will Bell the Cat?
(Inspired by the classic fable, with a moral twist for courage and leadership)
In the hush of a midnight mouse-meeting hall,
They gathered in whispers, one and all.
The Cat had prowled with silent might,
A ghost in fur, a thief in night.
"Let’s end this dread," the eldest said,
"Let’s hang a bell upon his head.
So when he stalks, we'll hear him near,
No more shall we live in fear!"
A cheer arose, bright with delight—
Until a voice broke through the night:
“But tell me, friends, though brave we chat…
Who among us will bell the Cat?”
Silence fell like winter snow,
Each heart sank low with silent "No."
For vision is bold, but hands grow weak
When danger stands and courage speaks.
So time rolled on, the Cat still king,
With fear his cloak, and stealth his wing.
Yet somewhere deep in mouse-heart’s core,
A whisper stirred: "There must be more."
For every dream that dares to start,
Needs not just mind—but lion-heart.
And though the risk may draw regret,
The bravest souls bear danger’s debt.
So if you dream of change at last—
Of ending pain, undoing past—
Don’t just clap for plans well sat...
Rise and be the one to bell the Cat.
